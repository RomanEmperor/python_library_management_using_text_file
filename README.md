# python_library_management_using_text_file
I wrote these codes as my school course work.
Here, I read a list of book details form a text file and display to user.
There are options to go to book returning process
The userSelection book is checked for its availability.
If the book is available, username of the user is asked.
If this is returning user, the book borrow or returning process is continued, else 
it is asked to user to create a new username.
